To help App Center support quickly investigate your build failure, please share the following information when opening a support ticket at https://appcenter.ms.

1. Any observations you have after trying the troubleshooting steps in this [build-failed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/build/troubleshooting/build-failed)
2. Provide the full App Center URL to the failed build.
3. Did build ever work before? When did the issue start to happen? Have you changed anything maybe related before the issue happened?
4. Does it build locally? If it works, please share related environment information with us, for example the IDE version. If it doesn't work, please fix it on your local side first, then try again in App Center Build.
5. We may have to gather additional information by running a debug build with your permission. Simply informat us early if we may run a debug build of your app.
